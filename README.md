# Powershell
Various Useful PowerShell scripts that I use to perform batch operations

NormalizeFilenames - Batch rename on files matching input params and can either perform a regexp replace or most importantly replace Diacritics in the filename

GitPullForEachRepo - Perform Git Pull on every local git repo found recursively to depth specified. Can also perform arbitrary git operations and even Git Maintenance
